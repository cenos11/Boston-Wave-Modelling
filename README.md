# Matlab
Boston Harbor Wave Modelling

I built this tool as a part of a project to quanitify the height of incoming waves based on wind speed and fetch. 

Getting Started

Install Matlab by MathWorks.

Installing

Copy the code into the editor in Matlab. Make sure the Boston Harbor PNG is copied into the code directory.

Executing program

Set the wind speed. This should be the maximum wind speed sustained for at least 15 minutes.
Click two points on shorelines that have open water between them. This is the fetch, or distance over which the wind generates waves.
Execute the program. The maximum theoretical wave height will be calculated depending on if the wave height is fetch-controlled or 
wind speed-controlled.
